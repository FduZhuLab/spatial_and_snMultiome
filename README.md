# snMultiome_script

the scripts for sn-Multiome data analysis

## 01.Clustering

Clustering analysis including preprocessing and subtype identification by Seurat.

## 02.DEG

Identification of area-specific DEGs at the subclass level.

## 03.Integration

Integration with the public reference datasets to determine the cell-type or compare with other species.

## 04.Spatial_deconvolution

Deconvolution of the spatial transcriptome data, including nucleus segmentation and the subclass/subtype weight prediction.

## 05.CellChat

cell-cell interaction analysis with cellchat

## 06.Peak_calling

generation of reproducible ATAC peaks according to the pipeline of [Bing Ren et al., 2021] (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03604-1).

## 07.SCENIC+

Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference from sn-Multiome data using the SCENIC+ pipeline.

## 08.DAP

Identification of area-specific differential accessible peaks (DAPs) at the subclass level.

## 09.AUP_enrichment

Enrichment analysis of AUPs in evolutionary ages and TE families using Fisher's exact test

## Map_file

These are the files that map the PBS_ARRAYID to a specific batch during job submission.
